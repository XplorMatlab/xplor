Install
*********************
xplor needs a few components available on Github:

Download the sources
------------------------

	* Clone or download `brick`_

	.. _brick: https://github.com/XplorMatlab/brick

	* Clone or download `colormaps`_

	.. _colormaps: https://github.com/XplorMatlab/colormaps

	* Clone or download `xplor`_
	
	.. _xplor: https://github.com/XplorMatlab/xplor

Don't know what is 'clone'?
If you 'clone' with git instead of 'download' it will be very
straightforward to obtain new versions of XPLOR in the future. All what you
need to know is the following:

- on Windows you need to install git from https://git-scm.com/download/win
  (git is already included on linux and OSX)
- to download a folder, type e.g. `git clone https://github.com/XplorMatlab/xplor`
- to update a folder with the latest version, go inside the folder and type
  `git pull`.


Configure Matlab
-----------------

	Add those downloaded folders to your paths:
