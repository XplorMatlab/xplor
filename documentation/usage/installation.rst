Install from Github
*********************
xplor needs a few components available on Github:

Download the sources
------------------------

	* Clone `brick`_

	.. _brick: https://github.com/XplorMatlab/brick

	* Clone `colormaps`_

	.. _colormaps: https://github.com/XplorMatlab/colormaps

	* Clone `xplor-Matlab-`_
	
	.. _xplor-Matlab-: https://github.com/XplorMatlab/xplor

Don't know what is 'clone'? If you 'clone' instead of 'download' it will be very straightforward to obtain new versions of XPLOR in the future. You can for example follow this simple tutorial: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Git_for_dummies

Configure Matlab

	Add those downloaded folders to your paths:
